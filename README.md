# About it

A game I made in just 6 days for [Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-8), whose theme was "You're not alone". You can play the game in your browser by clicking [here](https://johnny-connor.itch.io/survival-game).

# Development

In this jam, participants had 7 days to develop their games. I had planned to finish the game a day before the submission day so I could review my game and maybe add some features but, as usual in game jams, unexpected things happened, so the schedule went somewhat like this:

* Day 1: Game's Idea
* Day 2: Game's Art
* Day 3: Movement System
* Day 4: Combat System
* Day 5: Map and Story
* Day 6: Map and Story
* Day 7: Audio, Menu and Publishment Process

# Results

1,085 out of 6,103 participants have submitted their games.

Despite believing that a game can't be defined by just a number, here are the ratings I got in every category:

* Fun: #175
* Theme: #261
* Game Design: #292
* Overall: #339
* Graphics: #374
* Audio: #456
* Innovation: #486
