# About

A game I made for [Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-8), whose theme was "You're not alone". You can play the game in your browser by clicking [here](https://johnny-connor.itch.io/survival-game).

# Development

In this jam, participants had 7 days to develop their games. I had planned to finish my game a day before the submission day so I could have some time to further polish and maybe add some extra features in it. However, as usual in game jams, unexpected things happened, so the schedule went somewhat like this:

* Day 1: Game's Idea
* Day 2: Game's Art
* Day 3: Movement System
* Day 4: Combat System
* Day 5: Map and Story
* Day 6: Map and Story
* Day 7: Audio, Menu and Publishment Process

# Results

1,085 out of 6,103 participants have submitted their games.

Despite believing that a game can't be defined by just a number, here are the ratings I got in every category:

* Fun: #175
* Theme: #261
* Game Design: #292
* Overall: #339
* Graphics: #374
* Audio: #456
* Innovation: #486
